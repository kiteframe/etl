ETL package written in PHP.

=== Getting Started

You will need to install the project dependencies by running the following command.

[source,sh]
docker-compose run app composer install

=== Running Tests

The tests can be run using the following command.

[source,sh]
docker-compose run app composer test

=== Git Hooks

This project uses git hooks to enforce a consistent branch and commit naming convention. To enable these hooks during local development you will need to run the following command.

[source,sh]
git config core.hooksPath ./.githooks

Branch names should obey the following regex.

[source,sh]
^(feature|fix)\/#[0-9]+-[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$

Commits will then automatically be prepended with the issue number specified after the `#` in the branch name.
